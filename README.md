### Booking App Demo

https://nataze.github.io/BookingAppDemo/

This demo was extracted from a larger application that allows businesses to book clients' appoinments, schedule employees and send out call, SMS and/or email reminder to the client.

The demo contains a multi-step form that collects a client's information and booking time. All the data and api response are mocked.

The app was built with React 16.2/@rematch 1.0.6 and an older version of Material UI (3.7.1) using React router 4.3.1
