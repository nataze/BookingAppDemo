### Booking App Demo

This demo was extracted from a much larger application that allows client to book their services and sends out a call or SMS reminder using the twilio.

It contains just a multi-step form that collects the clients information and booking time. All the data and api response are mocked in this demo.

The main philosophy while creating the form was reusability, since the original app contains a lot of forms.

#### Technology Stack

The app used the React library (16.2) and and an older version of Material UI (3.7.1) combined with a rematch store that uses redux.

#### Start application

`yarn start`
